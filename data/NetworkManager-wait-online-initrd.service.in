# `nm-online -s` waits until the point when NetworkManager logs
# "startup complete". That is when startup actions are settled and
# devices and profiles reached a conclusive activated or deactivated
# state. It depends on which profiles are configured to autoconnect and
# also depends on profile settings like ipv4.may-fail/ipv6.may-fail,
# which affect when a profile is considered fully activated.
# Check NetworkManager logs to find out why wait-online takes a certain
# time.
